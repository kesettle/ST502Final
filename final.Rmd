## Introduction

_What is the general idea of testing for homogeneity? Perhaps also explain the purpose and outline of this project._


## Data Example

_Use hospital data given to conduct a_ $\chi^2$ _test for homogeneity._
```{r}
#create and print matrix of hospital data
rows <- rbind(a=c(41, 27, 51), b=c(36,3,40), c=c(169, 106, 109))
(hospDat <- matrix(data=rows, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, 
                   dimnames = list(c("A", "B", "C"), 
                                   c("Surgical Site Infections", 
                                     "Pneumonia Infections", 
                                     "Bloodstream Infections"))))
```


## Deriving the Likelihood Ratio Test

_Derive the LRT test for homogeneity; some work already done on page 151 of our notes. Pages 129, 132, 137, 139 may also be useful?_


## Simulation

_Simulate test with data. Potentially make use of code already given in notes. Two multinomial case only, with 3 categories in each multinomial. Plot summaries of simulations. Set seed for reproduction purposes._

Goal:

Process:

```{r}
#set seed for reproduction
set.seed(17)
```
